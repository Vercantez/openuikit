// A module literally named `UIKit` that re-exports OpenUIKit.
//
// Why this exists: the real-app harness (Sources/RealAppProbe) vendors
// UNMODIFIED source files from a shipping iOS app, and every one of them
// starts with `import UIKit`. Without this shim each vendored file would need
// that line rewritten to `import OpenUIKit`, which would show up in the
// adaptation ledger as noise — a module rename says nothing about API
// coverage, which is what docs/REAL_APP_TEST.md is measuring.
//
// It is safe on both platforms: `import UIKit` does not resolve to anything in
// the macOS SDK (UIKit ships in the iOS / Mac Catalyst SDKs only), and there is
// no UIKit at all on Linux, so this target is the only `UIKit` in scope.
//
// This target is a shim by definition and is labelled as such in the report.
// It contains no API of its own — one re-export, nothing else.
