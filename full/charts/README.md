# Charts (Linux starting point)

This directory is a clean-room Linux starting point for Apple's public
`Charts` module, seeded from the Xcode 26.1 iPhoneOS 26.1 symbol graph,
API digester, TBD exports, and pinned `dotnet/macios` bindings. It is not
wired into the shared guest package; that integration is a later
central-review step.

Unchanged application source continues to import `Charts`. Linux has no
SwiftUI layout engine, no display list, and no Apple chart renderer.
Scalar conversion, mark construction, host-driven `ChartProxy` mapping, and
stroke/interpolation retention are real. Layout, selection gestures, 3D,
and scroll interaction fail closed.

## What is real

- `Plottable` on the numeric types plus `String` and `Date`, with
  `primitivePlottable` identity round-trips.
- `PlottableValue.value` stores the authored label and value.
- `RectangleMark`, `LineMark`, `AreaMark`, and `RuleMark` convert
  plottable X/Y values to `Double` scalars (`Date` via
  `timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate`).
- `ChartProxy.position(forX:)` is fail-closed unless a host installs an
  `@_spi(OpenUIKitHost)` x-position mapping.
- `lineStyle` and `interpolationMethod` retain the authored
  `StrokeStyle` / `InterpolationMethod` on the returned wrapper.
- `PlotDimensionScaleRange`, `AxisMarkPosition`, `BasicChartSymbolShape`
  (circle through triangle), `NumberBins`, `DateBins`, and `Chart3DPose`
  catalogs are constructible.
- `Chart` data and `@ChartContentBuilder` inits compile.

The isolated Linux host gate compiles these sources with `swiftc` and
Foundation only. SwiftUI and CoreGraphics are not present as modules
there, so Charts uses module-local lookalikes for those dependency-owned
types. `tests/agent/ChartsDependencyIdentity.swift` imports the real
Foundation module for the later clean integration build.

## Fail-closed boundaries

- Chart selection, overlay geometry, and plot-frame mapping do not invent
  Apple layout. A default `ChartProxy` returns `nil` positions.
- `chartXSelection`, `chartOverlay`, axis builders, and legend modifiers
  are identity wrappers. They do not present UI.
- `Chart3D`, camera projection, and surface plots are declared types with
  empty bodies. There is no 3D renderer.
- Scroll-target and gesture modifiers do not claim Apple
  `ScrollTargetBehavior` timing.
- Synthesized SwiftUI `View` members on `Chart`, `Chart3D`,
  `ChartPlotContent`, `ChartAxisContent`, `Circle`,
  `BasicChartSymbolShape`, and `AnyChartSymbolShape` compile as no-ops so
  the overlay census can be declared without inventing layout.

## Existing Darwin host gate

The portable IceCubes consumer script remains Darwin-only (`xcrun`):

```sh
bash full/charts/tests/test_charts_host.sh
```

It is unchanged and is not the wave-6 Linux deliverable gate.

## Wave-6 deliverable gate

```sh
python3 -B full/framework-fanout/validate_seed.py --framework full/charts --phase deliverable
bash full/charts/tests/acceptance/test_host.sh
```

`tests/agent/ChartsRuntime.swift` records the runtime contract the focused
tests exercise. `tests/agent/ChartsLoadSmoke.swift` is the canonical
schema-v2 import/marker source.
